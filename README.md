# Stack and Queue Implementation in C

This repository contains my **custom implementation of Stack and Queue** using the C programming language.  
The goal of this project is to **enhance my understanding of data structures** by building them from scratch, without relying on prebuilt libraries or methods.

---

## 📚 About the Project
- Implemented **Stack** (LIFO: Last In, First Out).
- Implemented **Queue** (FIFO: First In, First Out).
- Written entirely in **C language** to strengthen logic building and pointer handling.
- Focused on **core operations** like `push`, `pop`, `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and traversal.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- **Stack Operations**
  - `push()` → Insert element at the top
  - `pop()` → Remove element from the top
  - `peek()` → View the top element
  - `display()` → Show all elements in the stack

- **Queue Operations**
  - `enqueue()` → Insert element at the rear
  - `dequeue()` → Remove element from the front
  - `peek()` → View the front element
  - `display()` → Show all elements in the queue
